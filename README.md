Semantic release plugin for vs code extensions

NOTE: This package is still experimental - `semantic-release` multi plugins are not released

#### Add config to package.json

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "semantic-release": "semantic-release"
  },
  "release": {
    "verifyConditions": ["semantic-release-vsce", "@semantic-release/github"],
    "getLastRelease": "semantic-release-vsce",
    "publish": [
      {
        "path": "semantic-release-vsce",
        "packageVsix": "your-extension.vsix"
      },
      {
        "path": "@semantic-release/github",
        "assets": "your-extension.vsix"
      }
    ]
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "semantic-release": "^11.0.0"
  }
}
```

If `packageVsix` is set, will also generate a .vsix file at the set file path after publishing.
It is recommended to upload this to your GitHub release page so your users can easily rollback to an earlier version if a version ever introduces a bad bug.
