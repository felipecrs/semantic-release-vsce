Semantic release plugin for Visual Stuio Code extensions

#### Add config to package.json

Use `semantic-release-vsce` as part of `verifyConditions` and `publish`.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "semantic-release": "semantic-release"
  },
  "release": {
    "verifyConditions": [
      "semantic-release-vsce",
      "@semantic-release/github"
    ],
    "prepare": {
      "path": "semantic-release-vsce",
      "packageVsix": "your-extension.vsix"
    },
    "publish": [
      "semantic-release-vsce",
      {
        "path": "@semantic-release/github",
        "assets": "your-extension.vsix"
      }
    ]
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "semantic-release": "^15.0.0",
    "semantic-release-vsce": "^2.1.0",
  }
}
```

If `packageVsix` is set, will also generate a .vsix file at the set file path after publishing.
It is recommended to upload this to your GitHub release page so your users can easily rollback to an earlier version if a version ever introduces a bad bug. 

If `pkgRoot` is set, the package will be published from this path. If not, it will be published from the root folder.

#### Working with older versions

This example is for `semantic-release` v15.  
Prior to v15, `prepare` was part of `publish` - if you are using v14, you must pass the `packageVsix` option to `publish` instead.  
Prior to v13, you had to override `getLastRelease` to use `@semantic-release/git` instead of the default `@semantic-release/npm`. This is no longer needed.
